'Nor I,' said the March Hare.

Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the
time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'

'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk
about wasting IT. It's HIM.'

The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month
is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.

Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'

'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit
the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she
had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by
railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon
made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she
was nine feet high.

they walked off together.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone
though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very
well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,'

the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a
little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who

'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.'

'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're
a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact
shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and
away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded
round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'

You're mad.'

'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.

the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on
the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
after that savage Queen: so she waited.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,

'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,
but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,
and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as
you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell
you how the Dodo managed it.)

'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at
home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top
of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how
many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting
somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there
was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,

in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt

hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In

nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't
think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it
began ordering people about like that!'

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,
and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little

sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'

She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a

to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than
you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without

almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.

However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste

buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just
like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting
like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and
straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute
or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see
it trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she said
to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
tree a few yards off.

'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'

gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!

'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at
the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling
about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was
something like this:--

from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in
his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,
and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--

'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know

she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great

of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to

it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,

'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said
Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it

The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a

If you've ever seen a movie about hackers from the 1980s, like *WarGa$[8;1HYou have a prompt, and you can type in a command and hit 'Enter' to execute it.  An example command would be:[10;9Htouch newfile.txt[12dThis command will create a file called `newfile.txt`.[14dHow to access the command line[15d------------------------------[17d**Mac OS X:** Go to /Applications/Utilities and click on "Terminal" or search for "Terminal" in Spotlight.[19d**Desktop Linux:** You can search for the "Terminal" application from the Dash.  Let's be honest, though, if you're running Linux, you probably don't need this tutorial.[21d**Windows:** Windows is a bit of a special case.  If you go to the Start Menu and click "Run", and then type "cmd" and hit enter, it will open the Windows version of the command line.  Unfortunately, the Windows version of the command l$[23;1Hhttp://www.cygwin.com/[25dA little more detail[26d--------------------[28dCommands generally take the format:[30;9H[name of the command] [option] [option] [option] ...[32dThe prompt will also show what directory you're currently sitting in.  Whenever you execute a command, you do it from a particular directory.  This matters because when you execute a command that involves a filename or a directory name,$[34;1H#### Relative Paths[36dSpecifying a file or directory as a relative path means you are specifying where it sits relative to the directory you're in.  For example, let's say you're in the `videos` subdirectory of the `files` directory.  You'll see this prompt:[38;9H/files/videos$[40dIf you execute a command like `touch newfile.txt`, it will create `newfile.txt` inside the current directory.  Relative paths don't start with a slash.[42d#### Absolute Paths[44dSpecifying a file or directory as an absolute path means you are specifying where it sits on the computer in absolute terms, starting from the top level.  For example, let's say you're in the `videos` subdirectory of the `files` directo$[46;9H/files/videos$[48dIf you execute a command like `touch /files/music/newfile.txt`, it will create `newfile.txt` inside a different folder, the `music` subfolder of the `files` folder.  *Absolute paths start with a slash.*[50dIf you use an absolute path, the command will do the same thing no matter what directory you execute it from.[52dSo these two commands will have the same result from the `/files/videos` directory:[54;9H/files/videos$ rm video.mp4[55;9H(This will delete the file `video.mp4` from the current directory)[57;9H/files/videos$ rm /files/videos/video.mp4[58;9H(This will delete `video.mp4` from the /files/videos/ directory, which happens to be the current directory)[60dThe same two commands will not have the same result if you are in a different directory:[61;110H(B[0;7m[ Read 358 lines ][62d^G(B[m Get Help[62;40H(B[0;7m^O(B[m WriteOut[62;79H(B[0;7m^R(B[m Read File[62;118H(B[0;7m^Y(B[m Prev Page[62;157H(B[0;7m^K(B[m Cut Text[62;196H(B[0;7m^C(B[m Cur Pos[63d(B[0;7m^X(B[m Exit[63;40H(B[0;7m^J(B[m Justify[63;79H(B[0;7m^W(B[m Where Is[63;118H(B[0;7m^V(B[m Next Page[63;157H(B[0;7m^U(B[m UnCut Text[63;196H(B[0;7m^T(B[m To Spell[3d[K[4dThe same two commands will not have the same result if you are in a different directory:[6;8H[1K	/files/text$ rm video.mp4[K[7;9H(This will try to delete the file video.mp4 from the 'text' subdirectory instead, because that's the current directory)[8d[K[9;9H/files/text$ rm /files/videos/video.mp4[10;9H(This will delete the file from the /files/videos/ directory, even though it isn't the current directory)[12dRemember:[K[14d**Starting a path with a slash** means you want to give the entire path and ignore what directory you're currently in.[15d**Not starting a path with a slash** means you want to give the path starting from the directory you're in.[17dIf you're ever unsure of what directory you're in, you can use the `pwd` (Print Working Directory) command to get the absolute path of the current directory.[19;8H[1K	~$ pwd[K[20d	/Users/Noah[21d[K[22dFile Patterns[23d-------------[K[25dIn most cases when you have to specify a file name or directory name, you can also specify a general **pattern** that might match multiple files.

To find all the Annabels' addresses, use the 'people' file:

	grep "Annabel" people

Notice that not all of the results are worth investigating.  Remember what we know about Annabel.

"Interview" the two possible witnesses by reading the correct line from the streets they live on:

	head -n 173 streets/Mattapan_Street | tail -n 1

This will give you just line 173 of Mattapan street, because it will take first 173 lines, and then take
the last line from those.

To find a matching license plate, or a matching car, you can use grep on the 'vehicles' file:

	grep "Honda" vehicles

	grep "Blue" vehicles

	grep "L337" vehicles

This doesn't give us anything useful - why not? Try using 'head' on the file to investigate its structure.

In order to actually get information about vehicles that might match our description,
we need to get multiple lines AROUND each match.  We can use the -A, -B, or -C option with grep:

	grep -A 5 "L337" mystery/vehicles

This will match the license plates that contain "L337" and, for each match, show us the five lines AFTER it.

To see who was a member of several different groups, you can combine their membership lists into one and search against that.

	cat Fitness_Galaxy AAA United_MileagePlus | grep "John Smith"

If you only want to see the number of matches, you can use grep's -c option (the c must be lowercase):

	cat Fitness_Galaxy AAA United_MileagePlus | grep -c "John Smith"

Or you can pipe the result to 'wc -l':

	cat Fitness_Galaxy AAA United_MileagePlus | grep "John Smith" | wc -l

Checking Your Answer on Mac/Linux:

  Copy and paste the following command, replace John Doe with the suspect's name you want to check, and execute it from inside the main clmystery directory:

  echo "John Doe" | $(command -v md5 || command -v md5sum) | grep -qif /dev/stdin encoded && echo CORRECT\! GREAT WORK, GUMSHOE. || echo SORRY, TRY AGAIN.

Checking Your Answer on Windows:

  Copy and paste the following command, replace John Doe with the suspect's name you want to check, and execute it from inside the main clmystery directory:

  echo "John Doe" | $(command -v md5 || command -v md5sum)

  This will give you a long code of numbers and letters. Copy and paste the following command, replace My Code with the code you got, and execute it:

  grep -qi "My Code" encoded && echo CORRECT\! GREAT WORK, GUMSHOE. || echo SORRY, TRY AGAIN.

Seeing The Answer:

  To give up and view the correct answer, copy and paste the following command and execute it from inside the main clmystery directory:

  echo " " && sed -n '/Z/p' encoded | tail -n 6 | cut -c 8,22,23,41 && echo " "

If you've ever seen a movie about hackers from the 1980s, like *WarGa$[8;1HYou have a prompt, and you can type in a command and hit 'Enter' to execute it.  An example command would be:[10;9Htouch newfile.txt[12dThis command will create a file called `newfile.txt`.[14dHow to access the command line[15d------------------------------[17d**Mac OS X:** Go to /Applications/Utilities and click on "Terminal" or search for "Terminal" in Spotlight.[19d**Desktop Linux:** You can search for the "Terminal" application from the Dash.  Let's be honest, though, if you're running Linux, you probably don't need this tutorial.[21d**Windows:** Windows is a bit of a special case.

Whenever you execute a command, you do it from a particular directory.  This matters because when you execute a command that involves a filename or a directory name,$[34;1H#### Relative Paths[36dSpecifying a file or directory as a relative path means you are specifying where it sits relative to the directory you're in.  For example, let's say you're in the `videos` subdirectory of the `files` directory.  You'll see this prompt:[38;9H/files/videos$[40dIf you execute a command like `touch newfile.txt`, it will create `newfile.txt` inside the current directory.
